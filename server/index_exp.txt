
This is an example of a server-side application 
written in JavaScript using the Express.js framework.

The code is importing several modules:

express is the framework that handles routing, middleware, and
other server-side functionality.

body-parser is used to parse incoming request bodies and make them
available as a JavaScript object.

cors is a middleware for Express that allows for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing 
(CORS). It allows the server to accept requests from a different origin than 
the server itself.

db is supposed to be a module that connects to MongoDB database
movieRouter is another module that contains the routing information for
a "movies" resource.

The code creates an Express application by calling express() and 
assigns it to the app variable. It then sets the port number to 3000
 and starts the server using the listen() method.

Once the server starts, it will listen for incoming requests
 on the specified port. When a request is made to the root path
  ('/'), the server will respond with "Hello World!" message.

The app is using a middleware for handling requests by using app.use() 
with cors and body-parser middlewares, also it's using app.use() to use
 movieRouter which will handle movie-related routes.

The code also connects to the MongoDB by db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 
'MongoDB connection error:')) It listens to the 'error' event 
of the db connection and logs the error message to the console.
