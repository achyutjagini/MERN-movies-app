The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function in JavaScript. 
An asynchronous function is a function that is designed to perform a task that takes 
a certain amount of time to complete, such as fetching data from a server, without
 blocking the execution of the rest of the code.

When a function is declared as async, it returns a special kind of promise called an 
"async function promise" which is resolved with the value that is returned from the function
, or rejected with an exception thrown from within the function.

Here is an example of an async function:


async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://some-api.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

The await keyword is used inside an async function, to wait for a promise to be resolved.
 In this example, the fetch() function returns a promise that is resolved with a response object. 
 The await keyword is used to wait for that promise to be resolved before moving on to the next
  line of code. Once the response is received, the json() method is called on the response
 object to parse the JSON data and return it.
