The code you provided is a React functional component named "App" which renders the main layout 
of a web application for movie booking.
It is using the react-router-dom library to handle client-side routing.

At the top of the file, it imports React and the react-router-dom library, which includes the
 BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch components.
Then it imports the NavBar component and three other pages component, MoviesList, MoviesInsert,
 and MoviesUpdate.
It also imports bootstrap CSS.

In the render() method, it returns JSX code that renders a div element with a title "Movie Booking", 
<Router> component, <NavBar /> component, and <Switch> component.
The <Router> component is used to wrap all the routes, it provides the browser's history and allows the use
 of the <Link> and <Route> components.
The <NavBar /> component is a custom component that renders the navigation bar of the application.

The <Switch> component is used to group a set of <Route> components together and renders the first one 
    that matches the current URL.
It contains three <Route> components that render different pages based on the current URL.
The first route, with path '/movies/list' and exact prop, will render the MoviesList component when the user
 navigates to the '/movies/list' URL.
The second route, with path '/movies/create' and exact prop, will render the MoviesInsert component when the 
user navigates to the '/movies/create' URL.

The third route, with path '/movies/update/:id' and exact prop, will render the MoviesUpdate component
 when the user navigates to the '/movies/update/:id' URL. The :id is a dynamic path parameter, which
  means it can be any value.

Finally, the component is exported as the default export, making it available to be imported 
in other parts of the application.
