
This code defines a React component called Links, which displays a
set of links that the user can click to navigate between different pages of the application.

The component imports React and Link from the react-router-dom library and styled component 
from the styled-components library, which is used to create and apply styles to elements
in the component.

It creates three constant, Collapse,List and Item which are styled components that are being 
used to style the navbar-collapse div, navbar-nav div and nav-link anchor tag.

The className attribute is being added using attrs() method provided by the styled-components 
library and it will apply Bootstrap's classes to the element, making it look like a Bootstrap's
navigation bar.

The Link component from react-router-dom is being used to create hyperlinks to different
pages of the application. When a user clicks on one of these links, it uses the
react-router library to navigate to the corresponding page without causing a full
page refresh, which provides a better user experience.

The component has a render method which returns JSX that will be rendered by React.
It is wrapped in a React.Fragment, that allows multiple elements to be returned 
without a parent node.

This component when rendered will have the links 'List Movies' and 'Create Movie' 
along with the Movie Booking application text that is a link to the root path '/'
and when clicked, it will redirect the user to the corresponding page without a 
full page refresh.

The code you provided is creating a React component called "Link" from the "react-router-dom" library.
The to prop is being set to "/movies/list" which means that when this Link component is clicked,
it will navigate the user to the "/movies/list" route. The className prop is being set to "nav-link" 


In general, the Link component is used to create a navigation link within a React application 
that uses the "react-router-dom" library. When clicked, the Link component will update the URL
 and display the appropriate content based on the route configuration.


"nav-link" is a class name provided by Bootstrap, which is a popular
front-end development framework. In Bootstrap, the "nav-link" class 
is used to style links within a navigation menu. When applied to an anchor tag,
it applies some default styling such as font color, padding, and hover effect.
You can use it for styling links in navigation menu.

It is typically used in combination with other Bootstrap navigation classes 
such as "navbar", "nav", and "nav-item" to create a full navigation menu. 
It can be customized through CSS to match the design of your website.


The classname "collapse navbar-collapse" is also provided by Bootstrap framework. 
It is used to create a responsive, toggleable navigation menu. When the screen size 
is below a certain breakpoint, the navigation menu will be hidden behind a toggle button, 
and when the button is clicked, the menu will be displayed.

The class "collapse" is used to create the toggle effect, and "navbar-collapse" is
 used to group the navigation links together. In this specific case, the class 
"collpase navbar-collapse" is being used as a default class for the Collapse component.
It is typically used in conjunction with Bootstrap's navigation classes such as 
"navbar", "nav", and "nav-item" to create a full navigation menu, and it can be 
customized through CSS to match the design of your website.
