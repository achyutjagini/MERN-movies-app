This code defines a React component called Logo. React is a JavaScript library for
building user interfaces and this code uses JSX syntax to create a virtual DOM 
(Document Object Model).

This component is using styled-components a library that allows you to
 write CSS styles in JavaScript.

It starts by importing React and the styled component from the styled-components library, which
 is used to create and apply styles to elements in the component.

Then it imports an image, logo.svg which is being used as the source for the
logo in this component.

It creates a new constant called Wrapper, which is a styled component 
that wraps the logo image 
and gives it a class of "navbar-brand". The attrs() method is used to 
add an attribute to the component,
in this case className.

It creates a class component called Logo which has a render method that returns JSX that renders
an anchor tag <a> with the Wrapper component, this anchor tag is the parent of an image tag <img>
that gets it's src from the logo import at the top of the code. The img tag has width and height
set to 50, alt set to "sambarros.com",

Finally, the component is exported so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the 
application.

The component when rendered, will display the logo.svg image with a 
link to "https://sambarros.com" 
and will have a class name of "navbar-brand" using the Wrapper 
component from styled-components.

''''

const Wrapper = styled.a.attrs({
    className: 'navbar-brand',
})``

This line of code creates a constant Wrapper which
 is an instance of a styled component created using the styled.a method. 
 The styled.a creates a component that renders an <a> element.

This component is then being modified by the attrs({}) method.
The attrs() method is used to add attributes to the rendered <a> element.
In this case, it's adding a class attribute and set it to 'navbar-brand'.



This JSX code renders an instance of the Wrapper component created earlier, with the attribute href set 
to "https://wikipedia.com". The Wrapper component is an <a> element, so this will render an anchor tag.

This attribute href is an HTML attribute that specifies the URL of the page the link goes to,
 it's been added to the Wrapper component, this way it will be added to the <a> tag, so when 
 the logo is clicked, it will redirect the user to "https://wikipedia.com"

When this component is rendered by React, it will generate the following HTML:

Copy code
<a class="navbar-brand" href="https://wikipedia.com">...</a>

It allows to set a hyperlink on the logo and redirect the user to a specific URL
 on the click event, which is useful to redirect the user to the main website, for example.
