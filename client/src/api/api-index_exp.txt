The code you provided is a set of functions that make API 
calls to a server using the axios library.
It starts by importing the axios library and creating an api instance with a baseURL 
of 'http://localhost:3000/api'.
This is the base URL of the server that these functions will be making requests to.

The code then defines five functions that correspond to different types of 
API requests:

insertMovie: makes a POST request to the '/movie' endpoint with the provided
payload as the request body.
getAllMovies: makes a GET request to the '/movies' endpoint to retrieve all movies.
updateMovieById: makes a PUT request to the '/movie/:id' endpoint with the provided 
payload as the request body.
deleteMovieById: makes a DELETE request to the '/movie/:id' endpoint to delete a movie 
with the provided id.
getMovieById: makes a GET request to the '/movie/:id' endpoint to retrieve a movie with
 the provided id.
Finally, the code exports an object that contains all of these functions as properties,
 and a default export of the object.
This allows the consumer of this module to import the whole object and access all the 
functions or to import a specific function.

These functions can be imported and used in other parts of the application to make API calls 
to the server, for example, in a component's useEffect hook to fetch data from the server
or to send data to the server when a form is submitted.
